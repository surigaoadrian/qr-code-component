## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

What I learned is that I was able to center contents by using flexbox. I have a hard time understanding flexbox and It made me happy to be able to fully understand it. I am also very happy to apply what I learned from SASS.

```css
body {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  min-height: 100vh;
  background-color: #d6e2f0;
  display: -webkit-box;
  display: -ms-flexbox;
  display: flex;
  -webkit-box-pack: center;
  -ms-flex-pack: center;
  justify-content: center;
  -webkit-box-align: center;
  -ms-flex-align: center;
  align-items: center;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
  -webkit-box-direction: normal;
  -ms-flex-direction: column;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning flexbox and also SASS.
